## Full Setup (If Starting Fresh)

### Option 1: Using GitHub Copilot in VSCode

1. Open the repository in VSCode:
   ```bash
   cd /home/nobby/webflow_screening
   code .
   ```

2. Open the **Source Control** panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)

3. Click the **"Publish to GitHub"** button

4. Select:
   - Repository name: `golden-wings-screening`
   - Visibility: **Public**

5. Copilot will handle authentication and push all commits

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI with Copilot

1. In VSCode terminal or GitHub Copilot Chat, ask:
   ```
   @terminal create a new public GitHub repo called golden-wings-screening and push this repository
   ```

2. Or run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd /home/nobby/webflow_screening
   gh repo create golden-wings-screening --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
   ```

### Option 3: Manual GitHub + Copilot Assistant

1. **Create the repo on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `golden-wings-screening`
   - Description: `Complete backend automation system for Golden Wings documentary screening RSVPs`
   - Public
   - **Don't** initialize with README
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Ask Copilot to push:**
   In VSCode Copilot Chat:
   ```
   Push this repository to https://github.com/calebmills99/golden-wings-screening.git
   ```

   Or manually run:
   ```bash
   cd /home/nobby/webflow_screening
   git remote add origin https://github.com/calebmills99/golden-wings-screening.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**If authentication fails:**
- VSCode's GitHub integration should handle auth automatically
- Or run: `gh auth login` and follow prompts
- Or use VSCode's "Publish to GitHub" button (easiest)

**If repo already exists:**
- Just run `git push` from the directory
- Or delete and recreate on GitHub

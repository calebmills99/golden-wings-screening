## âœ… What Works Right Now

- âœ… Form submits to your existing Google Apps Script webhook
- âœ… RSVPs saved to Google Sheets
- âœ… Confirmation emails sent automatically
- âœ… Calendar events created
- âœ… Mobile responsive design
- âœ… Phone number auto-formatting
- âœ… Form validation

## ðŸ”— Backend Connection

The form is already connected to your webhook:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxnU3k4duWhFRaMPnUVyp7NaGxG6qPN2Py43eNwCBZz8S0DN5xcMLgUdMAMb7iQ-ewQsg/exec
```

This is the same webhook used in your `test-webhook.sh` script, so all your existing backend automation (emails, sheets, calendar) works immediately.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Inspired By

Took design patterns from your guardrv6 project:
- Clean, modern single-page layout
- Gradient hero sections
- Professional form design
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Simple deployment (no build process)

## ðŸ“Š Test It Out

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, test the form at:
**https://calebmills99.github.io/golden-wings-screening/**

Fill out the RSVP form and verify:
1. Success message appears
2. Email confirmation arrives
3. Entry appears in Google Sheets
4. Calendar invite is generated
